# Genetic-Programming

A short explaination of genetic programming:  
You are tasked with improving the design of an electrical circuit board. To achieve this you modify the existing design by adding, 
removing, replacing, and moving components on the circuit board. However, a possibly more efficient way of improving the design
is by simulating the circuit board and generating a population of randomly generated circuit boards. Each population member is made up
of a different combination of components. The efficiency of each board is measured, the best two boards are selected and 
then their components are mixed together to randomly generate a new population of circuit boards.  
This process of selecting the best two population members and randomly mixing their components together is repeated 
until the target efficiency is met or the design can no longer be improved by this process.  
This process is a brief example of genetic programming.
