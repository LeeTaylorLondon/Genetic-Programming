* [ ] When running GUI.py it will crash because it cannot calculate the F score.
    This is because sometimes two ending nodes will be functions. This needs to be solved.
    To visualize this problem, I suggest visualizing nodes that cannot be calculated.
    To solve this problem I suggest ensuring all ending nodes are marked and converted into
    values. Is this a problem during mutation or generation? By determining the root M or G,
    then you may investigate that area of the code and solve it.

* [ ] Not all lines are rendered :(

* [ ] It is not rendering correctly such that it repeats and misses some nodes
    leading to incorrect rendered values

* [ ] Investigate and explain how the node structures are 'made' which are rendered.
    Because the structures being 'made' and rendered are incorrect. Example:
    DEBUG: [[<D=None|mul>], [<D=None|mul>, <D=None|sub>], [<D=None|mul>, <D=None|sub>],
            [<D=None|-4>, <D=None|-1>, <D=None|1>, <D=None|-1>], [], [], [], []]


### Node/Structure Generation - Solutions

* [ ] NodeStructure.py line 149 - replace if statement with an array of nodes for the
    current level (maybe + 1)

* [ ] Force nodes at depth limit to become 'terms'

* [ ] Force a pair of nodes without children to become 'terms'

* [ ] Force a node without children to become a 'term'

* [ ] _gs_force_children_pair - is not called if the structure cannot be
    interpreted/calculated
